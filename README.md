# Dog Breed Classifier Project

This is a project for the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://in.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101). The original repository this is cloned from prior to my undertaking of it can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/dog-project).


The `dog_app.ipynb` file is the jupyter notebook file used to complete the project. The resulting trained models are in the `saved_models` folder. The HTML export of the jupyter notebook can be found at `report.html`
